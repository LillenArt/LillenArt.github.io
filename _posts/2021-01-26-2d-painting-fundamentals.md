# Introduction
People often ask, "What are the art fundamentals?" This article seeks to list out each of the *basics* that I think a student should have a firm understanding of if they want to pursue 2D digital art / painting. The definitions included are for context, as a beginner may be unfamiliar with these terms. Use this list as you would notes from class. It is a guide to give you ideas on what to study or practice next. I will not be able to teach you these subjects, but you should be able to seek the knowledge out yourself.

## What order should I study these in?
This list is not necessarily in any kind of order. Many of the fundamentals influence each other, so in my opinion, there is no true linear order. An artist could choose to study either one or several of these at a time. It's up to you to figure out what works for you and build study habits accordingly. It's okay to pick a focus for a period of time. However, I caution you to not expect to completely 100% master a particular fundamental before moving on. Except to learn these gradually over a long period of time. Also, I do not recommend favoring a specific fundamental and ignoring all others. All listed are important. Think of each fundamental as a puzzle piece that fits into a greater whole. The goal for a beginner is to gain an basic understanding of each concept and the ability to demonstrate that knowledge in their work.

## Shapes
- Cube / Square
- Sphere / Circle
- Pyramid / Triangle
- Positive vs Negative
- Shape Language
- Gesture

## Values
How light or dark something is on a scale of white to black. Light to shadow.

## Form
- Highlight
- Cast Shadow
- Ambient Occlusion / Occulsion Shadows
- Reflected (Bounce) Light
- Terminator
- Local Color / Local Value

## Edges
- Hard (very sharp edge)
- Firm (strong edge slightly softer)
- Soft (soft blend between edges)
- Lost (no dileniation between edges)

## Color Theory
Understanding of color and effects on mood, perception, symbolism, culture, etc.

**The Color Wheel**
	- Primary (red, blue, yellow)
	- Secondary (orange, purple, green) 
	- Tertiary (mixes of primary and secondary colors)

- Hue (Color Appearence)

- Chroma (Percieved intensity of color)

- Saturation (Purity of color/ vibrance of color)

- Warm vs Cool

- Schemes:
	- Monochromatic
	- Analogous
	- Complementary
	- Split Complementary
	- Triads

- Color Harmony

- Color Constancy (Human interpretation of color is subjective and based on context, regardless of lighting.)

## Perspective
- 1 Point
- 2 Point
- 3 Point
- Atmospheric (Appearence of objects at distance)

## Proportion
Relative size and relationship between parts / objects. 
- Using the head to measure
- Human proportion
	- Male 
	- Female 
	- Androgyny
	- Faces
	- Child / Elderly

*Note - Proportion is often idealized, eggagerated, and gender binary. While I do recommend studying "male and female proportion", understand these are steriotypes and are not necessarily accurate or realistic. Drawing people who do not fit these molds is encouraged.*
