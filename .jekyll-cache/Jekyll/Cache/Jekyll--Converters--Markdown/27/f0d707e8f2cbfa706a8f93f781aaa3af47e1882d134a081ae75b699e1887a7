<h2 id="1-sketch">1. Sketch</h2>
<p>Start with a really rough sketch. Then lower the opacity of the rough sketch layer, make a new layer, and begin a more detailed sketch. If youâ€™re not confident in your observational skills, you can use a grid to help you eyeball where the features are. Keep the sketch layer at the top with the layer mode set to â€˜Multiplyâ€™.</p>

<h2 id="2-local-tones">2. Local Tones</h2>
<p>The local tone is basically the black and white equivalent of an objectâ€™s local color. <em>What is local color?</em> Local color is basically the native color of the object without any interference from direct or ambient light and shadows. I make a new layer under my sketch layer and pick 2 to 4 tones for this part to keep things simple. Use your mid tone to gauge how dark or light an object should be.</p>
